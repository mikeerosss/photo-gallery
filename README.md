Service protocols are predefined rules, guidelines, or standards that define how services (especially in the context of network communication, software, or APIs) should interact with each other. These protocols ensure that different systems can communicate effectively, reliably, and securely. They cover a range of tasks, such as data transmission, error handling, authentication, and the format of the messages exchanged between services.
